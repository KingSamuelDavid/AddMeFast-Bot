# AddMeFactBotMod
An automated Chrome extension bot that allows you to run AddMeFast automatically to collect points. 

### Disclaimer
I did not create this Chrome extension in any way, shape, or form. The original extension can be found here: [AddMeFast Tool for Collecting Points](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/addmefast-tool-for-collec/foefmapdjhbfdehppmnnfghcicfgohpd).

This modification was made purely for **educational purposes**, and I do **not condone or encourage** the use of this tool in any manner that violates terms of service, policies, or any legal agreements. Use this at your own risk.

### Purpose of Modifications
Many of the original scripts and functionalities in the extension were outdated or broken. After being approached by someone who requested a fix, I worked to restore some of these features. Just so you know, this modification is provided as-is with no guarantees of performance or safety.

### Installation Guide: Setting Up the Unpackaged Chrome Extension

1. **Download the modified extension files:**
   - Clone or download the repository files to your local machine.

2. **Open Chrome and go to the Extensions page:**

   - Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the extension files and select it.

5. **Verify installation:**

6. **Optional: Pin the extension**

### Notes:
- This extension modification is **for educational purposes only**.
- Always use caution when installing unpackaged extensions, as they can pose a security risk if misused.
- Again I can not stress enough I did not make this, I only fixed it as per request.
